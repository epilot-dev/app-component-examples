# Surfaces

Surfaces allow you to extend the UI of the epilot platform by rendering your own UI. 


Right now there are two types of surfaces:

- Custom Capability: check the folder `apps/custom-capability` for an example.

- Automation Action Config UI: You can render the configuration view of your custom automation action and exchange data with hooks provided by us. For an e2e example, check the folder `apps/custom-action-sst`
